In response to the crucial need for long-term conservation, the department works hard to maintain the coexistence of human activities and the natural environment. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937 provides legal protection for each individual species, demonstrating the department's dedication to maintaining Sri Lanka's unique biodiversity. Beyond preservation, activities include extensive research, habitat management, and community programming. Through these activities, the Department of Wildlife Conservation hopes to establish a healthy link between people and the island's rich biological environments, preserving the conservation and vitality of our natural heritage."
